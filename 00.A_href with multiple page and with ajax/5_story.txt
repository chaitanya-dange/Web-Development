till now made  few html page and throught anchor tab , span and button links are being made,but every time i click to buttom
the page is getting reloaded.This is the problem .

our requirement is that after click only particular portion should appear and not the fully reloaded page.

so here we gonna use concept of ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.)

This can be used in javaScript and jQuery aswell 

 can also be done with javascript by following three four step process
1. create new XMLHttpRequest()
2.open XMLHttpRequest
3.onreadystatechange function
4.sending request 

here going to do with jQuery to make thing simple this    get jQuery cdn link from net and paste it inside <script> before end of body tag.
